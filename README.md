*Learning Autograding with Python - Prof. Igor Machado Coelho*

**IMPORTANT:** If autograding (GitHub Actions) doesn't start for you, *check again the Invitation Link for
the activity* and hit the link named **update**.

If you want to try this open activity, see this invitation link: https://classroom.github.com/a/pEUy_63T

## Student Name

Student Name: **TODO - Please put your name in this README**

## Problem Description

This part describes the activity. This example activity consists in fixing two functions: one that adds two integers, and another that multiplies two integers.

## Objective

- Make the code pass correctly on all tests
   * only change the allowed files to achieve this goal (see instructions below with specific rules).

- The GitHub Actions should present a green marker when all tests are satisfied, and a red X when some (or all) of tests fail. 
    * **Advice:** You can click on the red X to verify which tests have failed (or if code didn't compile correctly).
    * **Advice 2:** If no autograding test appear, it may be required for the **instructor** to *update the test activities*, so that all student repos are refreshed (regarding autograding).

## Instructions

- You can ONLY change files `student.py` and `README.md`!
   * In file `student.py` put your implementations, and in `README.md` put your full name.

Explanations for the other files:

- file `tests.py` has all tests for the activity (DO NOT CHANGE!)

## Commands for Local Testing

- Command to build and execute tests: `python3 test.py`

## Notes

- Some test cases may receive individual grade, while others may only receive grade if passing together (or even all tests passing together).

- The final grade will be given automatically on every *commit*, and will only be evaluated until the deadline of the activity.

- The deadline is defined in GitHub Classroom
   * in case you cannot find it, ask the instructor or the course webpage

Check all other rules with instructor.
